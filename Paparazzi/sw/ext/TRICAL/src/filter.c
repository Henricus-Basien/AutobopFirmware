A bit about the UKF formulation in this file: main references are
[1]: http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~johnc/mag_cal05.pdf
[2]: http://malcolmdshuster.com/Pub_2002c_J_scale_scan.pdf

Since we don't know the attitude matrix, we use scalar values for measurements
and scalar measurement noise.

The relevant equations are (2a) and (2b) in [2]. Basically, the measurement
value is:

z = -Bt x (2D + D^2) x B + 2Bt x (I + D) x b - |b|^2

where B is the 3-axis measurement vector, and H is the reference field (making
|H| the norm of the reference field, which we know). Here, t is used as the
transpose operator.

The measurement noise is a scalar:

v = 2[(I + D) x B - b]t x E - |E|^2

where B is the 3-axis measurement vector, b is the 3-axis bias estimate,
E is the measurement noise, I is the 3x3 identity matrix, and D is the 3x3
scale estimate.

The implementation follows the general approach of https://github.com/sfwa/ukf
however there a number of simplifications due to the restricted problem
domain.

Since there is no process model, the apriori mean is the same as the state at
the start of the update step, and W' is just the set of sigma points. That in
turn means that there's no need to calculate propagated state covariance from
W'; it's the same as the covariance was at the start of the update step.

The scalar measurement model also simplifies a lot of the cross-correlation
and Kalman gain calculation.

Like the full SFWA UKF, and unlike the papers upon which this approach is
based, we're actually using the scaled unscented Kalman filter. The main
differences are in the choices of scaling parameters, including alpha, beta
and kappa. Given the relatively small dimensionality of the filter it's
probably not strictly necessary to use the scaled formulation, but we'd
already implemented that so it seemed easier to continue with that approach.

Reduces `measurement` to a scalar value based on the calibration estimate in

orientation calibration is required, the same vector can be supplied for

above, when we can just apply the current calibration estimate to the
measurement and take its magnitude. Look into this further if the below
approach doesn't work.
